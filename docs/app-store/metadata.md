# App Store Metadata

App Store Connect app ID: `6800029282`. Version `1.0` exists in `PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`; it must not be submitted until the production authentication/provider flows and Apple readiness checks pass.

TestFlight build `3` (`8f91c809-4ee2-428f-bbbf-c241355d101a`) is valid and assigned to the internal group `Cha-Ching Internal` (`483e4a13-43c0-4658-9c1b-8238e7b9a773`). It includes production APNs, the real-sales timestamp fix, provider readiness, and the signed-device notification registration path. Builds `1` and `2` are superseded.

The external group `Cha-Ching Beta` (`e95c8fca-3141-4ccb-917f-e7910bc37e0d`) contains `farleythecoder@gmail.com`, and build 3 is attached. The English TestFlight beta description and privacy URL are configured. External beta review submission is waiting only for the required review-contact phone number; Apple does not send the usable external invitation until that review is submitted and approved.

## Primary English (US)

- App Store name: **Cha-Ching: Payment Alerts** (25/30 characters)
- Subtitle: **Get Notified When You Get Paid** (30/30 characters)
- Installed app name: **Cha-Ching**
- Primary category: Business
- Secondary category: Finance

The App Store name and subtitle intentionally split the longer SEO phrase across two indexed fields while staying within Apple's 30-character limits. Do not repeat `Cha-Ching`, `payment`, `alerts`, `notified`, `paid`, or the company name in the keyword field.

## Product language

- One-line promise: Know the moment you get paid.
- Promotional line: Connect Stripe and PayPal, then let Cha-Ching keep the moment visible.
- MVP disclaimer: Stripe alerts have passed a real live-charge and signed-iPhone notification check. PayPal is account linking only in version 1.0.

Canonical machine-readable listing metadata lives under `metadata/`.

## Submission status

The App Store Connect record and version metadata are staged. Apple validation currently has four listing/build blockers:

- the valid TestFlight build must be attached to App Store version `1.0`;
- at least one required iPhone screenshot set must be uploaded;
- review contact details and honest reviewer instructions must be supplied;
- launch territories and App Privacy answers must be confirmed.

Do not submit version `1.0` for App Store review until Sign in with Apple and both provider connection paths pass the remaining production acceptance checks in GitHub Issue #1. Stripe's real webhook and signed-device notification checks now pass. Listing copy must not imply that PayPal alerts are supported in version 1.0.

Build `3` was signed manually with active provisioning profile `Cha-Ching App Store Push` (`QT23D7VC6C`) because Xcode's cached interactive Apple Account session is expired. The profile contains production APNs and Sign in with Apple entitlements. The installed Apple Distribution identity and App Store Connect API credentials remain sufficient for deterministic archive and upload automation when export runs with Apple's system tool path.

Apple limits both the localized app name and subtitle to 30 characters. Reference: [App Store Connect app information](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/app-information/).
